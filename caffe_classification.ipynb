    "[Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) is a deep learning framework developed by the Berkely Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) and community contributors.  Caffe is released under the BSD 2-Clause license.  Caffe emphasizes easy application of deep learning. All neural networks and optimization parameters are defined by configuration files without any hard-coding and Caffe offers a command line interface as well as scripting interfaces in Python and MATLAB.  Caffe is fast due it's C++ and CUDA foundation, but the code is extensible fostering active development.  There is a large open-source community contributing many significant changes and state-of-the-art features back into Caffe.  Neural networks trained using Caffe are also saved into a well-defined binary format that makes them easy to share - in fact, there is a model zoo hosted [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo) where you can download cutting edge pre-trained neural netwo
