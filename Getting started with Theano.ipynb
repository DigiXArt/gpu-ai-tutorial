    "Theano is a Python library that allows you to write symbolic mathematical expressions and compile them onto different computational architectures (in particular, CPU and GPU). It was developed by machine learning researchers at the University of Montreal. Its use is not limited to machine learning applications, but it was designed with machine learning in mind. It's especially good for machine learning techniques which are CPU-intensive and benefit from parallelization (e.g. large neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we will demonstrate Theano's explicit representation of symbolic maths and it's ability to compile that representation into efficient code to be applied to numerical data. We are going to work through one of the most fundamental applications of articial neural networks - the multi-layer perceptron.  This example will allow us to see a complete neural network being defined and trained from scratch, but the process we will follow in Theano is essentially the same for some of the much more complicated networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that we have seen in our previous classes.  We will finish the class by getting you started in extending the multi-layer perceptron example into a CNN."
